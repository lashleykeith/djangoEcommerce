# djangoEcommerce
A django ecommerce app

It has one problem in that when you register and click Place Order it does not render the success page located in myshop\orders\templates\orders\order.

#steps to start the app
1. In the folder myshop use the command `python manage.py makemigrations`.
2. Then use the command `python manage.py migrate`
3. Finally `python manage.py runserver`.

If you do not have Django 1.8 you might need to create a virtual environment that so you can download the necessary packages.
